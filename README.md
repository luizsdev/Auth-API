# What I learned doing this project

- **NestJS** - It was my first time using this amazing framework. I have learned many new amazing things, such as setting routes, setting controllers of API and  setting models for the database. I am really excited with this new tech, I'm sure it will improve my development skills.

- **Sequelize** - With this project I also learned this ORM, wich helped me a lot with managing the MySQL database, with it's decorators, things got so much easier.

- **TypeScript** - I just learned TypeScript, and doing this project helped my get the fundamentals really solid.

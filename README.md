# Auth-API
**A authentication system  made with NodeJS. It's a service where you can register your user, then use the credentials to login .**
# What I used in this project
- NodeJS
- MongoDB
- bcrypt
- Express
- bodyParser
- Mongoose
- dotEnv

# What I learned doing this project

- **Express** - I improved my knowledge with express routes and with receiving specific data from users.

- **Mongoose** - I've learned how to store specific data in the MongoDB database, such as HASH encrypted passwords

- **JavaScript** - Improved my development speed as I learned many new things and practiced the syntax

- **bcrypt** -  I've learned how to encrypt data, especially passwords, how to decrypt them and how to compare encrypted and non-encrypted data, all that with the hash system.
- **dotEnv** - I've learned how to hide important data from the user, improving the safety of the program itself.


# Conclusion

* While doing this project I have learned inumerous new technologies, such as encrypting data and the auth system itself, wich will help me with future projects and my career , in general.
